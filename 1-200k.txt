I thought I'd be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.&quot; It wasn't a question. &quot;You have your mother's eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wang. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wang for charm work.&quot;\n<JonJonB> &quot;Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wang. Eleven inches. &quot;\n\n<JonJonB> Harry took the wang. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wang above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls\n\n<JonJonB> &quot;Oh, move over,&quot; Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wang, tapped the lock, and whispered, 'Alohomora!&quot;\n\n<JonJonB> The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wang had still been in his hand when he'd jumped - it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.\n\n<JonJonB> He bent down and pulled his wang out of the troll's nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.\n\n<JonJonB> He ran onto the field as you fell, waved his wang, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground. Then he whirled his wang at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them.\n\n<JonJonB> Ok\n<JonJonB> I have found, definitive proof\n<JonJonB> that J.K Rowling is a dirty DIRTY woman, making a fool of us all\n<JonJonB> &quot;Yes,&quot; Harry said, gripping his wang very tightly, and moving into the middle of the deserted classroom.
