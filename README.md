Going through the udemy course, api section, I figured, I'll get the bash.org / qdb quotes, and then server them as an api. Long story short: made a scrapper, 
which served me up to 200,000, and then they implemented a scrapper defense. I worked a bit more on using proxy, headers, that was fun but the proxies are unreliable and so... meh.

In the end, I made a user interface, which serves quotes: you can choose how many, and can choose range of ratings... And yet, this isn't an API though, but it was a fun project. Onto the actual API creation.

edit1:
I forgot to mention: I only got to quote number 200k, and yet it goes up to like 995k. I have located the databases of quotes in other people's githubs (there's a file with the links in the repo), and I might one day add the rest of the quotes and expand upon this. But I feel like, 
I have had my share of fun with this for now, and must continue with my studies. I tend to do this. I'll make my life much more difficult than what the lessons require - because, I'm not quite satisfied with the depth of the lesson. A month or two passes, and now - I have gained some
depth of knwoledge - and also fell behind on the lessons.
