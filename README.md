Going through the udemy course, api section, I figured, I'll get the bash.org / qdb quotes, and then server them as an api. Long story short: made a scrapper, 
which served me up to 200,000, and then they implemented a scrapper defense. I worked a bit more on using proxy, headers, that was fun but the proxies are unreliable and so... meh.

In the end, I made a user interface, which serves quotes: you can choose how many, and can choose range of ratings... And yet, this isn't an API though, but it was a fun project. Onto the actual API creation.
